# Terraform hooks

## terraform-docs
[terraform-docs/terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs)

The `terraform-docs` plugin is a go program which parses your terraform module and outputs documentation for all the versions, providers, inputs, and outputs. It can add these things to the middle of your README too and makes reference a piece of cake.

## tfsec
[tfsec/tfsec](https://github.com/tfsec/tfsec)

The tfsec plugin analyzes your terraform for everything from general security concerns, like hardcoding a password, to provider-specific things like forgetting to encrypt your S3 buckets.

## tflint
[terraform-linters/tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)

The tflint plugin can not only check your terraform but check it against the cloud youâ€™re running on
