# GitHub Actions

The GitHub actions (don’t worry about other platforms because the terraform registry only pulls from GitHub) run these hooks (and sometimes other things) to publicly shame anyone who breaks the conventions (although there is a time and place for moving quickly and ignoring the advice of verbose and occasionally broken CI checks). Basically, __GitHub Actions check to make sure all these scripts are happy__.

For creating new terraform modules we use a template repo, [rhythmictech/terraform-terraform-template](https://github.com/rhythmictech/terraform-terraform-template), that you can use too! It comes with all the bells and whistles that I’m talking about.
